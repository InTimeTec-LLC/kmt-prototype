# InTimeTec ADPQ Vendor Pool Prototype 2018 - Knowledge Management Tool (KMT)

## Introduction
KMT Prototype is being developed as part of Vendor Pool Selection for State of California to demonstrate our agile design and development techniques. 

KMT is a comprehensive collaborative tool that helps to seemlessly share knowledge across cross-functional teams and organisations.  Using this tool , employees can share, contribute, organize and discover information thus making the collaboration effective

## Technical Approach

### a. Assign one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted; 

We established a Delivery Lead, Vijaya Arucapalli to act as scrum master, prioritizing work, providing input, and holding sole accountability to leadership for all aspects of the prototype.

## Design Process

### Understand People's Needs
We have setup an Research interview meetings with few personnel working in State of California.

We will heavily rely on these personnel’s inputs to design the application

This process will also involve capturing feedback across multiple iterations from users, the product owner, and project team
