# InTimeTec ADPQ Vendor Pool Prototype 2018 - Knowledge Management Tool (KMT)

## Introduction
KMT Prototype is being developed as part of Vendor Pool Selection for State of California to demonstrate our agile design and development techniques. 

KMT is a comprehensive collaborative tool that helps to seemlessly share knowledge across cross-functional teams and organisations. Using this tool, employees can share, contribute, organize and discover information thus making the collaboration effective.

## Technical Approach

### a. Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted

We established a Delivery Lead, Vijaya Arucapalli to act as the Scrum Master, prioritize work, provide input, and holding sole accountability to leadership for all aspects of the prototype.

### b. Multidisciplinary and collaborative team

We assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that included the following roles:
1. Delivery Lead & Scrum Master - Vijaya Arucapalli
2. Overall Technical Architect - Shiva Dixit
3. Technical Architect (Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Test) - Inwinder Kochhar
4. Front End Web Developers - Harish Patidar, Sweta Lavaniya, Manish Tripathi
5. Back End Web Developers - Koteswara Varanasi, Rohan Sahu, Sachin Singh, Rakshit Rajeev, Ashish Y, Manoj Mewara
6. Visual Designers - Jennifer Barker, Parul Sharma, Nidhi Saini, Inwinder Kochhar
7. DevOps Engineer - Simarpreet Gujral, Yashwant Mahawar
8. Quality Assurance - Raunak Shah, Jitendra Sen, Raksha Deshpande
9. Writer - Grace Arpana
10. Business Analyst - Rob Tuft
11. Product Manager - Anthony Chen

## Design Process

### Understand people's needs
We have setup an Research interview meetings with few personnel working in State of California. We will be going through a list of questionnaire with them to understand the end user need for such collaborative knowledge management tool. We will heavily rely on these personnel’s inputs to design the application.

### “User-centered design” techniques or tools
Work in Progress

## Development Process
Agile Methodology for development is used where in we kickstarted the project by defining the requirements in the form of user stories in Jira Scrum board and established the cadence, roles, and responsibilities of this agile development effort. We will be using 1 week sprint model to deliver tangible usable product at the end of every sprint. This process will also involve capturing feedback across multiple iterations from users, the product owner, and project team.
