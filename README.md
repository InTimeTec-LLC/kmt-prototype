## Design Process

### Understand people's needs
We have setup an Research interview meetings with few personnel working in State of California. We will be going through a list of questionnaire with them to understand the end user need for such collaborative knowledge management tool. We will heavily rely on these personnel’s inputs to design the application.

### “User-centered design” techniques or tools
We have created wirefreames and moqups for both desktop and mobile devices application.
